# Arduino-Obstacle-Avoiding-Robot
This is a automatic robot which is able to detect obstacles and find its way around them. It is also powered by a solar panel.
As mankind is expanding its horizons beyond our planet and learning deeper about our own
history we are in need of newer and more versatile technology that will aid us in our ventures.
A prominent example of this are rovers and small robots that are sent to hostile environments
and different planets in order to conduct research or simply help the researchers in gathering
samples or going into spaces that we cannot normally look into.
Curiosity and Opportunity are two such rovers sent to the hostile environment on Mars in
order to conduct research. They were controlled all the way from earth, were durable enough
to survive the harsh sandstorms on Mars, were cost effective, had an extensive array of
robotic components and an unbeatable software system allowing the rover to do so much
more. These have been the avenues of great discovery on both Mars and the moon.
Its application extends even more on earth where it can be used in hostile forest
environments, deployed as defence equipment, and can be used for sample collection by
archeologists from spaces where they cannot fit.
Our project is a smaller version of this rover. It is a simple model aspiring to be a
representation of these rovers and how useful and functional they can be.
Another aspect of this project is the renewable energy angle. In a day and age where fossil
fuels such as crude oil, petroleum, diesel are about to get exhausted, we need to search for
better, more efficient, and environment friendly ways to power our devices. In this project we
hope to set an example of using such resources.
The project uses rechargeable Lithium ion batteries which are less wasteful. These batteries
can be charged by a solar panel during the day for the robot to be functional at all times of the
day.
